In addition, I hope you are satisfied with the idea that a function is just a chunk of code that does a specific conceptual task. There is also the advantage that you can treat a function as a black box and just use it without knowing exactly what is going on in it. Sometimes this is good because too many details can be detrimental; other times it can be unwise as you do not know how an output is generated.\n",

Since the value of sep is not specified, Python used the default value of sep, which is a white space.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Abstraction of details__ The most important benefit of functions goes beyond programming and relates to your ability to strategize. If you break up a complicated solution into modular chunks (i.e., functions), it becomes easier to think about it because you are not dealing with all the details all at once. As a result, it is easier to focus on your overall solution because you are not distracted by unnecessary information. __This hiding of ‘stuff’ is called abstraction__ in computer science lingo. The concept of abstraction can be tricky to grasp. So, let me share an analogy related to driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vehicle has many ‘abstracted’ systems, amongst which the engine is a good example. You do not need to know the engine’s details (e.g. electric, petrol, diesel, guineapig) to use it. You can use the engine of almost any car because you are not required to know what happens inside. This __frees up your resources__ because you are __not distracted by unnecessary details__. Of course, there will be times when you want to know how an engine works to pick the best engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reusability of code:__ If you encapsulate a chunk of code in a function, it becomes straightforward to reuse it instead of copying and pasting at different places. This means your code will be _shorter and more compact._\n",
    "\n",
    "__Maintainability of code:__ With functions, your code is easier to change and maintain because you need _only make changes in one place_, at the function definition.\n",

You will get a better feel for when to use functions with experience, but _please bear in mind that functions can be misused._"
